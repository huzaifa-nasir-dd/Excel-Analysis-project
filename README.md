Store Data Analysis Using Excel Analysis Tools With Result''s Dashboard
This project presents a complete Excel-based data analysis solution for "Zaifi's Store". The workflow includes cleaning raw data, transforming it for analysis, and building a visually engaging dashboard using Pivot Tables and Excel features. Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, standardizing date formats, correcting inconsistent text entries, and handling missing or malformed values using Excel functions like TRIM(), IFERROR(), TEXT(), and string parsing formulas. After cleaning, the data was transformed to include calculated columns such as Month, Category, and Profit using formulas like IF(), VLOOKUP(), and arithmetic operations. Once the data was prepared, several Pivot Tables were created to analyze key business metrics including total sales, product performance, regional trends, and customer behavior. An interactive dashboard was then developed with slicers, conditional formatting, and pivot charts to enable dynamic filtering and clear visual insights. This project demonstrates how Excel can be effectively used for end-to-end data analysis and reporting without requiring advanced BI tools
